# Correlate

This repository contains the workings of my thesis, related to emissions estimation for aircraft engines. Things featured here are:

1. Correlation equations meant for estimated the amount of emissions produced during the operation of an aircraft engine (correlations\_class.py),
2. Visualization functions that are used to compare ICAO retrieved data with experimental data and the values caclulated through correlation equations using boxplots, swarmplots, violin plots and dot plots
