Notes:
This report contains the inputs parameters for the corresponding model trained
on the ICAO data for the CFM56 engine family. Four operating points are
considered along with three features (Fuel Flow, Thrust rating and Pressure
ratio) and one response (EI NOx). Along with this report, the loss plots and the
averaged value (per batch) of RMSE and MAPE, for the each epoch, are saved.
