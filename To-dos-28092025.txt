1. Incorporate ann class into models_class and test -> Done
2. Run ann for all operating points 
3. Introduce more metrics from the class and Learning curves
4. Attach validation on the error plot
5. ~~Try to use CUDA for gpu acceralation~~
6. Research on the importance of metrics and epochs and other parameters of the NN
7. Look into Deep Learning book 

Questions:
- What is the right sequence for the ANN set-up?

Results:
- Problem with the use of the data-dataloader interface. While all of the examples
I have seen use the dataloader inside a for-loop waiting for 2 outputs from the method,
my implementation does not reach that result. It might be a problem of data preparation,
meaning that I might need to include a custom dataset function
- The end goal here is to get the train-test error vs epoch plot. Currently I get 
the training error but the results might very well be wrong because of the above problem,
will have to implement it and then be sure,
- The above also raise concerns over the workings of the pipeline. Might need to 
create a new class that houses all of the ANN related stuff and a corresponding 
outputs (Save) and input file

Todos:
- Integrate the dataset function (done)
- Introduce the dataloader (done)
- Plot Validation and Training error together (done)
- Create separate funtions and classes for anything ANN related (done)
- Introduce more metrics to the mix
- Integrate model/parameter saving and test input file
- Extend the code for all operating points
